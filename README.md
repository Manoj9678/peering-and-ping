vnet peering and VM ping
VNet peering between regions, enabling seamless VM communication through ping tests across networks.

🌐 Peering involves two networks connecting directly to exchange traffic between them. This connection can be established through a private connectivity or through a public internet exchange point, which reduces Cost Efficiency, Improved Performance, Better Control, Scalability.

Pinging a network is used to check the reachability of a device on a network and the time it takes for data to travel. It shows,
·      Connectivity Testing.
·      Latency Measurement
·      Troubleshooting, Monitoring.
💡Both peering and pinging are foundational concepts in networking, each serving distinct purposes in maintaining and optimizing network performance.

I have already learned about peering and pinging, then I gained a solid understanding of network efficiency and performance. These skills enhance ability to manage and troubleshoot networks effectively, providing practical insights into network optimization and reliability.
